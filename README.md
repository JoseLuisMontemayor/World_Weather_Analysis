# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to take a trip app to the next level, using the technology of Google Maps Directions API. Users will be able to input their prefences of their vacations, in terms of weather and location. With code and the access to Directions API, the visuals for the map and the weather are easier to analyze and also with extra data of each specific city.
